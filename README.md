# ItemFusion
A showcase of recursive JavaScript programming by looking up the most efficient path of a node-edge tree. By walking down a tree through thousands (to millions) of itterations, the lowest price to obtain an 'Item' in a game is returned.

The full list of possible items can be found in 'item-fusion-data.txt'.
